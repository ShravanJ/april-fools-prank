# april-fools-prank
A small april fools prank from 2014

Context
=======
So back in late 2013, iOS 7 was released and with it came the infamous iCloud activation lock - a security feature that prevented reactivation of the phone if its reported stolen. So naturally, people (theives) would try to circumvent the feature so that they could reactivate their stolen phones. Now comes the so called "iCloud bypasses", which were complete scams that promissed the user to be able to reactivate a locked phone. So, in my typical jokester fashion, I decided to play along with these scammers and release a fake utility for april fools day. I posted a link a twitter and it exploded - everyone was very excited that there was finally a real bypass, until they actually ran it. I regard this as one of my finest pieces of work, and after a long and hard search for it, I have finally found it and decided I should share it once more.
